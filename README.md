## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this election audit analysis is to determine the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count andthe county with the highest turnout.

## Challenge Summary
This script can be used in any election. The file names would need to be updated as well as the column numbers to extract the proper information. Also, variable names should be changed so that they correspond to names and numbers they are representing. Such modifications will allow the script to be used for national elections where the county can be replaced with state and county elections where the county can be replaced with precincts.
